In this step, we will run a bigger benchmark and run out of space to show how easy it is to add space to a volume dynamically.

### Step: Run benchmark to make the database run out of space

Open a shell inside of your container.
```
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=postgres | grep Running | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD bash
```{{execute T1}}

Use pgbench to run a baseline transaction benchmark which will try to grow the volume to more than 1 Gib and fail.

```
pgbench -c 10 -j 2 -t 10000 pxdemo
exit
```{{execute T1}}

* You will see a lot of error messages, if you look at the first one it will say "No space left on device". The pod is going to fail but that's ok, we'll let STORK reschedule it.

### Step: Expand the volume and run benchmark again

Note that kubernetes doesn't yet support modifying the PVC after creation so we have to do this operation directly on Portworx with the pxctl cli tool. This will run in _Terminal 2_ and ssh to one of the data nodes:

Get the volume name
```
ssh node01
POD=`/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume list --label pvc=px-postgres-pvc | grep -v ID | awk '{print $1}'`
```{{execute T2}}

Inspect the volume:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl v i $POD
```{{execute T2}}

As you can see the volume is within 10% of full and so we need to expand it using the following command:
```
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume update $POD --size=2
```{{execute T2}}

Now that you have expanded the volume you can go back to the step above and run the benchmark again.

```
pgbench -c 10 -j 2 -t 10000 pxdemo
```{{execute T1}}
