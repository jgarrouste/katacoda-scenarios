### Step: Install [STORK](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/) and wait for Portworx to be ready.

Stork is a Cloud Native storage orchestration runtime scheduler plugin. It translates a scheduler's orchestration decisions into something that an external cloud native storage solution can act upon. By doing so, it extends Kubernetes with more stateful awareness of the underlying storage provider, it's capabilities and state.

Install STORK:

```
kubectl create -f stork-scheduler.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Make sure all system containers are running:
```
watch kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all the pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

If you want to tail logs : 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johanhaleby/kubetail/master/kubetail && chmod +x kubetail && mv kubetail /usr/local/bin/
kubetail -l name=stork -n kube-system -s 10h
```{{execute T2}}
